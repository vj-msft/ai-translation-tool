**Primary User Activity**: Acting - Users input text and receive immediate translations

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Users need quick, reliable translation between multiple languages using different AI models for varying quality and context understanding.

**User Context**: Professional and personal use cases where users need to translate text quickly between different languages, with the ability to choose translation quality levels.

**Critical Path**: Select model → Choose target language → Input text → Get translation → Copy result

**Key Moments**: 
1. Model and language selection (sets expectations)
2. Translation execution (core value delivery)
3. Result display and copy action (completion)

## Essential Features

### Multi-Language Target Selection
- **What it does**: Dropdown selector with 20 popular languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc.
- **Why it matters**: Enables global utility and accommodates diverse translation needs
- **Success criteria**: All languages produce accurate translations with proper character encoding

### AI Model Selection
- **What it does**: Radio button selection between GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Azure Translation
- **Why it matters**: Different models offer varying levels of context understanding and translation quality
- **Success criteria**: Each model produces distinct translation approaches and maintains consistent quality

### Real-time Translation Interface
- **What it does**: Dual-pane layout with input textarea and output display
- **Why it matters**: Clear separation of input/output with immediate visual feedback
- **Success criteria**: Translations appear within 3 seconds, interface remains responsive during processing

### Smart Send Button
- **What it does**: Dynamically enables/disables based on input text and model selection
- **Why it matters**: Prevents errors and guides user through proper workflow
- **Success criteria**: Button state accurately reflects when translation can be performed

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with approachable efficiency
**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, tech-forward but not intimidating
**Visual Metaphors**: Language translation, global communication, precision tools
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes functionality over decoration

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent highlights
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - conveys trust and technology
**Secondary Colors**: Light grays and whites for clean backgrounds
**Accent Color**: Teal-green (oklch(0.65 0.18 180)) - for interactive elements and progress indicators
**Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust for professional tool, teal accent adds energy without being distracting
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Background (near-white) + Foreground (dark blue-gray) = 12:1 contrast
- Card (white) + Card-foreground (dark blue-gray) = 16:1 contrast
- Primary (deep blue) + Primary-foreground (white) = 8:1 contrast
- Accent (teal) + Accent-foreground (white) = 4.8:1 contrast

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) across all elements for maximum clarity
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, labels, and body text through size and weight
**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism with excellent legibility
**Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, generous spacing in form elements
**Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
**Legibility Check**: Inter excels at small sizes and extended reading

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Top-down flow from model selection → language selection → translation interface
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding creates breathing room and reduces cognitive load
**Grid System**: CSS Grid for main layout, card-based organization for feature grouping
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough whitespace for calm feeling while maintaining productivity

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle loading indicators and state transitions reinforce system responsiveness
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading spinners for translation progress, smooth button state changes
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal motion that supports function without distraction

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for feature grouping and visual hierarchy
- Select dropdown for language choice (searchable, organized)
- Radio buttons for model selection (clear mutual exclusivity)
- Textarea with character counter for input
- Button with loading states for primary action

**Component States**: All interactive elements have distinct hover, focus, active, and disabled states
**Icon Selection**: Languages icon for branding, Globe for language selection, PaperPlane for send action
**Spacing System**: Consistent 4px base unit scaling (4, 8, 16, 24, 32px)

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved across all text and interactive elements
**Keyboard Navigation**: Full tab order support with visible focus indicators
**Screen Reader Support**: Proper labeling and ARIA attributes for all form elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**: 
- API timeouts during translation
- Unsupported character sets in certain languages
- Very long text inputs causing performance issues

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Retry mechanism for failed translations
- Character limits with clear feedback
- Error states with actionable guidance

**Technical Constraints**: 
- LLM API rate limits
- Browser clipboard API permissions
- Network connectivity issues

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Language list could expand, additional AI models could be integrated
**Testing Focus**: Translation accuracy across language pairs, UI responsiveness under load
**Critical Questions**: 
- How do we handle right-to-left languages in the UI?
- Should we detect source language automatically?
- What's the optimal character limit for translations?

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines multiple AI translation services with comprehensive language support, giving users both choice and flexibility. The clean, professional interface removes barriers to adoption while the smart validation prevents user errors. The multi-language support makes this truly globally useful rather than limited to English-only workflows.
